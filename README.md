# Machine-Learning-Driven-Optimization-of-Output-Force-in-Photo--Actuated-Organic-Crystals

These files contain the machine learning scripts used in "Machine-Learning-Driven-Optimization-of-Output-Force-in-Photo--Actuated-Organic-Crystals". 
I have uploaded files used for LASSO regression and Bayesian optimization. The command flow for Bayesian optimization is summarized in the figure below.

Additionally, a video of the actual execution can be viewed at the following URL(https://youtu.be/Wkfgf90MYVs).
