# Machineã€€Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals

These files contain the machine learning scripts used in "Machine-Learning-Driven-Optimization-of-Output-Force-in-Photo--Actuated-Organic-Crystals". 
I have uploaded files used for LASSO regression and Bayesian optimization. The command flow for Bayesian optimization is summarized in the figure below.

Additionally, you can watch a recorded video of the actual execution of Bayesian optimization at the following video.
