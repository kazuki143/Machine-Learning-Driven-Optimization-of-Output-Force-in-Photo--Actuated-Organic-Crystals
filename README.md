# Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals

These files contain the machine learning scripts used in "Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals". 
I have uploaded files used for LASSO regression and Bayesian optimization. The command flow for Bayesian optimization is summarized in the figure below.
