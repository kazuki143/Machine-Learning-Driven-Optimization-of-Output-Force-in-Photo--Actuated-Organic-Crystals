# Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals

These files contain the machine learning scripts used in "Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals". 
I have uploaded files used for LASSO regression and Bayesian optimization. 

## LASSO_regression folder
There are two files.

`LASSO_regression.ipynb`: File for data loading, pre-processing and LASSO regression

`Young's_modulus_dataset.xlsx`: Dataset for LASSO regression (This file is the same as "Supplementary Data.xlsx" in "Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals".)

## Bayesian_optimization folder
There are several files.

`main_bayesianoptimization.py`: 

`settings6.py`: 

`utils7.py`: 

`initial_dataset.xlsx`: Initial data for Bayesian optimization

The command flow for Bayesian optimization is summarized in the figure below.

Additionally, you can watch a recorded video of the actual execution of Bayesian optimization at the following video.
