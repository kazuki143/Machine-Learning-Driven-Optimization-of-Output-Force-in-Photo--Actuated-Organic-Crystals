## LASSO_regression Folder
`LASSO_regression.ipynb`: File for data loading, pre-processing and LASSO regression

`Young's_modulus_dataset.xlsx`: Dataset for LASSO regression
(This file is the same as "Supplementary Data.xlsx" in "Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Output Force in Photo-Actuated Organic Crystals".)

## Bayesian_optimization Folder
`main_bayesianoptimization.py`: The main script for performing Bayesian optimization

`settings6.py`: Input the setting

`utils7.py`: Contains functions used for Bayesian optimization

`initial_dataset.xlsx`: Initial data for Bayesian optimization

`./automation/stage_control.py`: Controls the movement of the stage holding the slide glass with a fixed crystal

`./automation/uv_light_control.py`: Controls the UV light irradiation device

### Setting arguments
The types and meanings of the arguments of settings.py correspond to the following, respectively.

**Run arguments**
- mode (str): Operation mode, either 'experiment' or 'simulation'.
- work_name (str): Name of the saved files.
- repeat (int): Number of repetitions for each experiment.
- n_trial (int): Number of optimization trials.
- n_trial_P (int): Number of trials where parameter P is fixed.
- random_state (int): Random seed for reproducibility.
- init_file (str): Filename of the initial dataset.
- results_folder (str): Directory where results will be stored.

**Acquisition Function:**
- acquisition (str): Method for selecting the next evaluation point {'ucb', 'ei', 'poi'}.
- kappa (float): Trade-off parameter for the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) method {1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20}.
- xi (float): Trade-off parameter for Expected Improvement (EI) and Probability of Improvement (POI).

**Gaussian Process Kernel:**
- kernel (str): Type of Gaussian Process kernel {'rbf', 'matern'}.
- length_scale (float): Length scale for RBF or Matern kernel {0.1, 1, 10, 100}.
- nu (float): Smoothness parameter for the Matern kernel {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3}.

**Search Space:**
- space (dict): Defines the parameter ranges for Bayesian optimization.
    - 'E' (tuple): Young's modulus range (GPa).
    - 'L' (tuple): Crystal length range (μm).
    - 'P' (tuple): Light intensity range (mW/cm²).
    - 'T' (tuple): Crystal thickness range (μm).
    - 'W' (tuple): Crystal width range (μm).
- E_exp (list): List of experimentally measured Young's modulus values from bending tests.

### Execution command
To perform Bayesian optimization, simply run the following command:

`python main_bayesianoptimization.py`

The command flow for Bayesian optimization is summarized in the figure below.

Additionally, you can watch a recorded video of the actual execution of Bayesian optimization at the following video.

### Output Folder
`./results/`: After executing main_bayesianoptimization.py, the results are saved in this directory as .json files.

### Note
- Since the fabricated crystals are small and fragile, they may break during the experiment. If this occurs, the experiment must be repeated. Due to the difficulty in handling the samples, appropriate judgment by the experimenter is essential. Therefore, steps requiring human clicks and inputs were introduced. 
- We conducted simulations before implementing Bayesian optimization. The results and details are described in the supplementary figure 5. Code up to #303 defines functions necessary for Bayesian optimization and specifies destination files for saving results, making it extremely important code.
